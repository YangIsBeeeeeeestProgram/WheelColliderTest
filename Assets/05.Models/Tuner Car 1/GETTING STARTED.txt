Thank you for purchasing Tuner Car Model Kit

Important! There are a few things you need to do. 
Firstly, drag the car prefab to your current scene. 
Add a new layer, name it whatever you want. 
Select Tuner Car in the hierarchy.
Change the current layer to the layer you just created (Yes, change children). 
Select the reflection probe of the car. 
Under 'Culling Mask', uncheck the car's layer. 

These steps are necessary to ensure that the car's body only reflects the enviroment and doesn't reflect the interiors. 
If you are not going to use the reflection probe, you may ignore the steps above and deactivate the reflection probe object instead.

Note :
- All the tuning parts and lightings are already in the prefab
- The Lights are all turned off in default
